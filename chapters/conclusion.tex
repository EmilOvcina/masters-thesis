\chapter{Conclusion}
A tool for visualization and refactoring microservice architecture written in Jolie has been developed.
The tool allows the user to see how the different components of the Jolie application interacts and also see what key information is associated with each component.
The tool also allows the user to directly modify these components and see what changes happen to the architecture.
Capabilities that allow the user to architecturally refactor the code to create embeddings and other architectural patterns have also been added to the tool.
