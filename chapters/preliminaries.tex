\chapter{Preliminaries}
This chapter will provide a context for the thesis.
The reader will be able to gain the necessary background knowledge in order
to understand the purpose of the thesis and why it can be useful for developing Jolie applications. This essentially builds on the motivation
described in the previous chapter.

This chapter will describe some of the relevant definitions of the microservice architecture paradigm, as well as provide
the reader with a quick overview of the Jolie programming language, and what other similar tools exist both for Jolie and other programming languages.
